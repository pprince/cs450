 = JDM's EXAMPLE MPX =
 =====================

 The DEMOS/ and HELP/ directories and all files below were downloaded from:

	 - http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~jdm/classes/cs450/protected/MPX/index.html

 (Except for those named README, and the actual directory structure/hierarchy.)


 Information from JDM's site:
 ----------------------------
 This section contains demonstration executable files for each of the MPX
 assignments. Just to show you it can be done :-)

 To enable the HELP command, it is also necessary to download the helpfiles.

 The demo version of COMHAN expects to find the helpfiles in the relative
 directory ..\HELP. Therefore the following steps should be taken to setup the
 demos:

   1. Place the demo executables in a directory named DEMOS.
   2. Place the helpfiles in a directory named HELP.
   3. Ensure that DEMOS and HELP are both in the same directory or both at the root level of the same drive.

 The demos can be run from the Windows command prompt, e.g.:

    CD DEMOS
    C:\DEMOS> MOD-R1
