BLOCK		[1 argument]

Sets a process to the blocked state.  The argument must be the
name of an existing process.  It is not considered an error if
the process was already blocked.

This command does not specify a specific resource for a process
to wait for.  It is intended only for testing basic process
management mechanisms.
