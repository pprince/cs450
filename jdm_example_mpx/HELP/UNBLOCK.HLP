UNBLOCK		[1 argument]

Sets a process to the ready state.  The argument must be the
name of an existing process.  It is not considered an error if
the process was already in the ready state.

This command does not affect the actual status of any resources
the process may have been waiting for.  It is intended only for
testing basic process management mechanisms.
